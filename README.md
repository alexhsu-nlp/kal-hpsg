# kal-hpsg
An HPSG grammar fragment of Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic).

This repository includes an HPSG grammar fragment of Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic) still under development. It started as a [LING 567](https://courses.washington.edu/ling567/) grammar derived from the [Grammar Matrix](https://github.com/delph-in/matrix), and hence follows the [DELPH-IN](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/home/Home/) framework. 

> [!WARNING]
> Currently there is no guarantee that all parts of this grammar reflect the standard Kalaallisut grammar, and it is by no means close to completion.

As of Nov 16, 2025, this grammar fragment has achieved more than 25% coverage on the [corpus built from *Kalaallisut Sungiusaatit*](https://github.com/alexhsu-nlp/kal_igt_corpus_kalaallisut-sungiusaatit), which contains more than 1,500 sentences. 

The grammar is currently being tested with [LKB](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/LkbTop). It might take a while for [ACE](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/AceTop) supports to be included.
