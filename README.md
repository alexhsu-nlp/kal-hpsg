# kal-hpsg
An HPSG grammar fragment of Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic).

This repository includes an HPSG grammar fragment of Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic) still under development. It started as a [LING 567](https://courses.washington.edu/ling567/) grammar derived from the [Grammar Matrix](https://github.com/delph-in/matrix), and hence follows the [DELPH-IN](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/home/Home/) framework.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently there is no guarantee that all parts of this grammar reflect the standard Kalaallisut grammar, and it is by no means close to completion.

As of Nov 16, 2025, this grammar fragment has achieved more than 25% coverage on the [corpus built from *Kalaallisut Sungiusaatit*](https://github.com/alexhsu-nlp/kal_igt_corpus_kalaallisut-sungiusaatit), which contains more than 1,500 sentences. **As of Dec 6, 2025, the coverage on this corpus has increased to 40%.**

The grammar is currently being tested with [LKB](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/LkbTop), and the sentences are parsed in morpheme segmentation forms rather than their orthographical forms (see [KARMA](https://github.com/alexhsu-nlp/karma/tree/main/karma) for an attempt to build a morphological analyzer compatible with the notations in this grammar). It might take a while for [ACE](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/AceTop) supports to be included.
